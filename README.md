Per the directions of the homework, there are two folders in this repo, PyBank and PyPoll, which are two different challenges/problems. 
Each challenge has a python source code file and two subfolders. The Resource subfolder contains the original csv file downloaded for the assignment. 
The Analysis folder contains the output of the code in the form of a .txt file. 
I noticed that the .txt files do not appear like a .txt file (with carriage returns) in GitHub.

All code was originally written by me. 
I did ask for assistance during Office Hours on the syntax for coding the relative paths to the CSV and .txt files (since I tested my code first using the paths to my computer). 
I created lists to store the data from the CSV files representing columns. 
The PyBank challenge was more difficult than PyPoll. 
I used the concept of counters again (also used in VBA last week) to determine totals. 
Similarly to VBA/Excel I ran into the problem that Python did not recognize the data in the Date column as something that could be counted. 
I taught myself how to write to a file (other than a new CSV) and include carriage returns in the .txt file. 
For the PyPoll problem, the hardest part was identifying the winner. 
I created a nested list to store the candidates’ names and total votes, and then ran a conditional loop to match the name with the highest total (this one stumped me, 
but I found the nested list concept through a Google search – I was trying to find the code to find the index of an item in a library, to no avail). 
I checked to see if there were any typos in the Candidates column also – this probably was not necessary.
